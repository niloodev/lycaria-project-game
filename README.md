## Proposal
Project developed by; Ezequiel Nilo (Programming), Axel Galz (Design), VamnKuma (Animation and Pixel ART) and Izábi Ferros (Soundtrack).

Lycaria is a turn-based online game, it is divided in three parts; the client, server and the game. The project was developed with the intention of creating a simple and light form of entertainment for potential players, while developing a complex story behind it.

*The TCC (course conclusion project) was presented and delivered on 06/12/2021 as a project from Analysis and Systems Development technical course in ETEC Antônio de Pádua Cardoso.*

* The game must get the room info from [Lycaria Client](https://github.com/niloodev/lycaria-project-client) and connect to it.
* Have a Load Screen (or Card Screen) to display the character and name of each player in the current match.
* Sync all game info and psychics with [Lycaria Server](https://github.com/niloodev/lycaria-project-server) using Colyseus real-time connection and schemas.
* Have at least one playable map for the matchs, and a minimun of one playable characters (Aegis).

## Tools

This application uses the following open-source packages:

##### Core ones.
- [Unity | Unity 2D](https://unity.com/pt/solutions/2d) (Game development engine)
- [URP | Universal Render Pipeline]() (Is a script that allows some graphic configurations, like [Post Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tjYz6Ab0oc) used in this project)

##### Real-time connection
- [Colyseus (Client)](https://docs.colyseus.io/colyseus/) (Colyseus client, its like a WebSocket client)
